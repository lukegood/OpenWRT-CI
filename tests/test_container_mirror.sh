# Container mirror connectivity smoke test (build-time).
#
# History: docker.1panel.live began returning 403 to anonymous manifest
# requests on 2026-09-08 (observed on RE-CS-07/RE-SS-01 after ebd46aa flash).
# Anonymous manifest reachability also varies by egress IP/User-Agent, so this
# test probes a candidate list and passes if ANY mirror serves an anonymous
# manifest 200. The winning mirror name is printed so callers can wire it into
# device scripts (e.g. check-post-flash.sh container smoke test).
#
# Wire into CI with `WRT_SKIP_MIRROR_TEST` to bypass in restricted runners.
